# Overview üö†
Online store for garden center based in Navan, where you can purchase a wide variety of plants Users should be able to access the site and select the plants they'd like to purchase. Users can also view events related to the garden center. Subscribed users can obtain a newsletter. The site mainly uses Django, CSS, Javascript and python. CRUD functionality is found on all models. Stripe is integrated for payments. Emails are sent once users register to the site or newsletter. Admin can access a stock list page. 

# Business_Model

## Incentive

  There is a growing demand for plants and flowers. It's possible Covid 19 re-ignited people's
interest in gardening, and a huge increase in online purchases in general. In 2020 the global online
market size was estimated at $6 billion and it's expected to grow by 10% yearly until 2028. Some argue
people are now more environmentally aware, and the spread of mobiles makes it far easier to purchase online. Online shopping can allow more personalised purchases and there has been an improvement in logistics, so people are more confident their product arrives safely. One only needs to look at the rise of the Green Party in Ireland, to see that the interest in plants is not just a fad. A UK online nursery named Patch has seen it's revenue increase by 500% yearly since its launch in 2016.

## Target Audience, Competitors, and unique Selling Point

1. Target Audience

Those most likely to buy plants include young families who have purchased a new home and those retired.Those living in the suburbs and countryside are more likely to want plants. Additionally, where transport is limited, people may be more incentivised to shop online. Those willing to purchase plants will typically be 'middle earners'. 

2. Competitors
   
   Competitors include other online nurseries, such as Gardens4You.ie or thegardenshop.ie.
   
3. Choice of plants
   
   Plants were chosen that were in the price range of middle earners in Ireland. Research on other websites helped determine which plants were in the highest demand. Plants were also selected by their 
   availability. Local plants were prioritised. Prior to launching the site surveys were sent out to the local population, whereby people selected their favourite plants. A professional photographer was
   used to ensure the plant images were of the highest quality.

4. Promotion of Site
   
   A social media account was created using facebook [FB business page](/media/readme/fb-business-page.png). A robots.txt file was used to improve the sites search engine optimization score. 

5. Customer Loyalty

   A newsletter was created to keep customers informed about the site. There is also an events section whereby customers can come to events and increase footfall at the garden center.

## UX/UI

### STRATEGY

#### Goals ü•Ö<br>

The UX focused on ensuring the site was as visual as possible. User stories were used to break perspective clients needs into tasks. The UI involved good use of navigation through anchor links and appropriate sizing for different devices. A toggle dropdown menu was used for smaller screens.

#### User Stories üìñ<br>

* As a user interested in buying plants, I can look up plants online and purchase them.
* As a user I can see what events have occurred or will be occurring, so I can keep informed.

### SCOPE üî≠<br>

### STRUCTURE‚ò†<br>

#### Database diagrams

# ORM

* As there is one category to several plants. And there are always several plants to one category.
* The relationship here is a one to many, which involves the use of a foreign key.
* The foreign key field is always placed where the 'many' is - i.e the plants model.

# Work Flow

## Issues

Issues were created initially based on the projects user stories. Issues were then added to the repo's issue page as the project progressed. Issues were managed using a kanban board in the repo's projects section. Here issues were given prioritisation, and their status could be reviewed. 

![Issues Example](/static/pdfs/issues.png)

## Agile

#### Sprints

Issues were linked to github milestones. Milestones were used as Agile 'sprints'. 

There were 4 sprints

![Sprints](/static/pdfs/4sprints.png)

* Sprint 1: Involved the initial set up of the project. Getting the template and core models/views.

* Sprint 2: During this sprint the aim is to have the site connected to Stripe and a user can purchase plants online.

* Sprint 3: During sprint 2 much of the project was completed. A priority now was to ensure that I've 3 custom models, as per the requirements. Then I could testing.

* Sprint 4: Top priorities were to ensure that I've met all the requirements: 3 custom models, Get AWS working to store images & connect to Heroku, Test all features, Complete README, Fix css issues on small screen sizes.

### SURFACE/DESIGN<br>

I chose a light green, as I felt this related to the plant theme. I then used Huemint to generate a color pallete from this: #fad3b0, #5cc7f9 and #1275e0.

### Django Packages

- [Requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)


Many of the packages here are dependencies of core packages. The main packages used were:
- Django as the framework
- django-allauth for user permissions
- django-crispy forms to make forms look and perform better
- factory-boy to create fake data for automated tests
- pillow to manage images
- python-dotenv to create a virtual python environment and keep dependencies local
- waitress as a subtitute for gunicorn as I was using windows
- whitenoise for static support when deploying to a server

### Infastructural Technologies

- PosterSQL - used as the database
- Heroku - where site was deployed

## Languages used

- Python, Javascript üêç

## BUGS OR ERRORS üêõ üòµ// Issues which take me more than 2 hours to solve

* 95% of the bugs I was able to resolve through using stackoverflow. 

* Stripe Webhook not responding
  For weeks I couldn't figure out why webhooks wouldn't work when I made a payment on Heroku using stripe. If I hard coded the stripe secret key locally and then pushed this to heroku it would work. Eventually I noticed that in my Heroku config variables I had 'STRIPE_WB_KEY' instead of 'STRIPE_WH_KEY'. However even when I fixed this it still wouldn't work. I then added the STRIPE_WB_KEY to heroku through the heroku cli. This time it worked.  
  
* Could not access django
  I changed my 'venv' virtual environment folder from 'venv' to '.venv'. This resulted in my requirements.txt file emptying and I couldn't access django. I had to delete everything in the django db and make migrations from scratch. I also had to re-upload the fixtures.
