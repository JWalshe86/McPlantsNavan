# Business Model

## Incentive

  There is a growing demand for plants and flowers. It's possible Covid 19 re-ignited people's
interest in gardening, and a huge increase in online purchases in general. In 2020 the global online
market size was estimated at $6 billion and it's expected to grow by 10% yearly until 2028. Some argue
people are now more environmentally aware, and the spread of mobiles makes it far easier to purchase online. Online shopping can allow more personalised purchases and there has been an improvement in logistics, so people are more confident their product arrives safely. One only needs to look at the rise of the Green Party in Ireland, to see that the interest in plants is not just a fad. A UK online nursery named Patch has seen it's revenue increase by 500% yearly since its launch in 2016.

## Target Audience, Competitors, and unique Selling Point

1. Target Audience

Those most likely to buy plants include young families who have purchased a new home and those retired.Those living in the suburbs and countryside are more likely to want plants. Additionally, where transport is limited, people may be more incentivised to shop online. Those willing to purchase plants will typically be 'middle earners'. 

2. Competitors include other online nurseries, such as Gardens4You.ie or thegardenshop.ie.  


# ORM

* As there is one category to several plants. And there are always several plants to one category.
* The relationship here is a one to many, which involves the use of a foreign key.
* The foreign key field is always placed where the 'many' is - i.e the plants model.
